# Release notes for the NEXT version — English only (the release linter rejects German).
# One bullet per user-facing change; these become the ioBroker changelog, then this
# file is auto-reset to this template on the next stable release. Suggested style:
#   <Widget type> - <what changed>          e.g.  Thermostat - target temperature now shown inline
#   <General / widget-independent change>    e.g.  Tabs can be hidden from the tab bar
#   Settings - <what changed>               e.g.  Settings - add hex color mode for RGB lights
# Issue reference (optional): append (#519) — or paste the full issue URL — and the
# release turns it into a changelog link. release.ps1 also asks per entry.
- AI assistant - the shipped widget schema, recipes and theme tokens are back in step with the app, so the newest options (slider scale, list timestamps, select cells, tab badges, own themes) are visible to a connected AI again, and the slider scale is now part of the measured minimum heights it plans with
- Theme - own colours for the navigation icons (tab bar, section bar/menu, menu widget) plus a colour for inactive labels; the section navigation now follows the navigation colours instead of the accent (#640)
- Theme - the active chip colour is no longer overruled by the accent: the carousel honours it too and the tint behind an active chip is painted again (#640)
- Theme - the light/dark choice above and below the theme editor is one choice now, and saving an own theme captures the half you are editing instead of the one your admin browser happens to show (#640)
