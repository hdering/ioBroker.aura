# Release notes for the NEXT version — English only (the release linter rejects German).
# One bullet per user-facing change; these become the ioBroker changelog, then this
# file is auto-reset to this template on the next stable release. Suggested style:
#   <Widget type> - <what changed>          e.g.  Thermostat - target temperature now shown inline
#   <General / widget-independent change>    e.g.  Tabs can be hidden from the tab bar
#   Settings - <what changed>               e.g.  Settings - add hex color mode for RGB lights
# Issue reference (optional): append (#519) — or paste the full issue URL — and the
# release turns it into a changelog link. release.ps1 also asks per entry.
- Advanced chart - value labels at the chart edges no longer overlap the y-axis numbers or snap back over the edge after a redraw (#703)
- History table - new widget that lists the recorded values of a datapoint from a history adapter (history, sql, influxdb): the last N values or a time range, with date and time in one or two columns (#760)
